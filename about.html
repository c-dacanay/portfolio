<p>Hey! I'm Christina, and artist, designer and project manager living in Brooklyn, NY.</p>
<p>As an artist I work with words, pictures, and web interactions. Sometimes I try to examine how we can create a healthy social fabric on the web while staying committed to complexity. Other times I just try to make small, peaceful spaces for myself and others.</p>
<p>Currently I'm working as Design Lead for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.playmultiverse.com/">One More Multiverse</a>, a tabletop RPG platform. Iâ€™m also a post-doctoral fellow at Interactive Telecommunications Program at NYU, where I service students and steward <a target="_blank" href="https://ml5js.org/">ml5.js</a>, the friendliest machine learning project on the web. You can find a long, winding version of the professional story <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vT8mrtgjzzZ-FnLiG5MM0N5Y4u2g3sbDXI92mhg6eQA/edit#gid=0">here</a>. </p>
<p>Most of my favorite things have been made with other people. If you'd like to work on something together, or just want to talk, please send me an email. :) </p>
<p>Thanks for looking.</p>
