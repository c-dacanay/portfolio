                    <p>One More Multiverse (OMM) was a highly ambitious platform for telling cinematic stories with tabletop games. We created custom gameplay experiences for Dungeons & Dragons, Blades in the Dark, and Yazeba's Bed and Breakfast. As OMM's Design Lead I led both Product Design and Playtesting efforts for the launch of the platform and releases of all three games.</p>

            <!-- <h3>project: redesigning the HUD</h3>
            <p>As OMM planned to launch the alpha product out of closed beta it became essential to reorganize the HUD
                on our virtual table top. Due to a long phase of engineering led development the platform was bloated
                with tools that were difficult to discover and use. New users often needed to attend our staff-led
                tutorial events in order to get started. We wanted to use the opportunity to cut some deprecated
                features while also organizing the HUD to be able to reasonably scaffold features in the future.</p>

            <h3>goals</h3>
            <p>OMM’s core mission was to transform the way game masters and players could tell stories visually in the
                online space. Therefore the primary challenge became how to balance clarity and flexibility with the
                huge array of creative tools that platform had to offer. We needed to support the creative needs of our
                storytellers while still making the tool accessible enough for new players to hop in. In order to build
                confidence, we needed to carefully observe how our current users played and assess where they struggled.
                We also used the opportunity to determine if legacy features were being used through data-driven
                methods. </p>

            <h3>research</h3>
            <p>I created a feature map of all the features in the current HUD with their location on the screen,
                including modals and nav items. Visualizing this map gave us a sense of the overwhelming amount of user
                choice presented when first opening the platform. </p>

            <p>I took a semi-random sampling of 35 features to try and determine different types of categorization.
                After conducting a card sort we decided to organize features according to what they modified: the Verse
                (eg. the world settings), the Level (eg. placing assets on the map), or Play (eg. chat, rolling dice).
            </p>

            <p>In the process of developing proposals for new designs I also conducted a series of interviews where I
                observed players creating new Verses, prep for sessions, and play community games to test conclusions.
                After playtesting mocks of the designs for a handful of players we began refining and polishing the UI
                to begin implementation.</p>
