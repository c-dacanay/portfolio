        <p>One Amongst Many is a spacial data visualization that represents 16 women who have contributed to the history of computing. Illuminated orbs containing biographical information about the women are suspended from the ceiling; their z-heights are correlated to how well known they are through their number of Wikipedia backlinks. As users walk through the space, they are invited to investigate the orbs that illuminate when tilted. As they are read throughout time, the orbs get brighter and brighter, symbolizing the growing awareness of these women’s contributions.</p></div>
