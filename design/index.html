    <section id="intro"><p>Hi! I'm Christina. I'm a multi-disciplinary designer and illustrator based in Lenapehoking, so called Brooklyn.</p></section>
    <section id="recently"><p>I'm currently the <a href="">Design Lead at One More Multiverse</a> where we help bring TTRPGs to life. Before that I worked as a <a href="">Product Designer at Codecademy</a> where I focused on creating a streamlined and engaging platform for learners. I used to art direct children's books and graphic novels as a <a href="">Senior Designer for Penguin Random House</a> and Macmillan. I've also done a variety of <a href="">freelance</a> visual, product, and UX design.</p></section>
    <section id="specialities"><p>I've ran design sprints during blue sky phases, conducted research to gather requirements, and focused on fully zoomed-in UI polish. I genuinely love every part of the process so long as it contributes to a shared goal with a good team. Plus, learning is always fun. <a href="">My resume</a> has more skills and specialities. </p></section>
    <section id="outside"><p>Creativity is a practice and I exercise as much as I can outside of work. I've got another <a href="">website for the artsy stuff</a>, if you like. My favorite projects have always made in collaboration with, or alongside, other people.</p></section>
