<h1>Course Info</h1>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The Capstone Studio course asks students to produce an interactive project with documentation, a research paper, and a personal portfolio.</p>
<p>The interactive project will illustrate students‚Äô unique interests as well as evidence of competency within the field of interactive media production. Students are encouraged to develop their project around a theme previously explored in their work. Projects will be presented and critiqued repeatedly throughout the capstone process to peers, faculty, and industry professionals. A final presentation of the interactive project will be delivered late in the semester.</p>
<p>The research paper (4000‚Äì5000 words) will focus on at least one aspect of the interactive project: e.g. culture, theory, philosophy, or history, the project context, and/or production methods. For example, students may write about their project‚Äôs reception by a set of specific users, or by users who are part of a larger culture, society, or market. It is important that students think beyond the project itself and situate it in a broader context accessible through research. The research paper will include an annotated bibliography of the books and other resources they used for their research.</p>
<p>Students will also be guided in the production of an online portfolio to showcase their work and accomplishments to the outside world. Graduates will be evaluated by their portfolio when applying for jobs, graduate school, artist residencies, grants, and the like. Portfolios will be tailored to the demands of each student‚Äôs future goals and target audience.</p>

<h3>Objectives</h3>
<ol>
<li>Understand and be able to conceptualize, prototype and implement a complete interactive media project.</li>
<li>Develop an understanding of contemporary professional, academic and artistic applications of media arts, and the place of their own work in those environments.</li>
<li>Understand the importance of research and scholarship as a part of the project development process.</li>
<li>Become comfortable with critique and giving feedback to peers.</li>
<li>Communicate their ideas effectively both in oral and written presentations.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Expectations and details</h1>

<h3>‚òéÔ∏è Absences</h3>
<p>At most two (2) unexcused absences will be tolerated without effect to your grade. Any more than two (2) unexcused absences will result in a lowering of your final grade by one whole grade for each unexcused absence. For example, three (3) unexcused absences will result in your highest possible grade being a B instead of an A. Four (4) unexcused absences will result in your highest possible grade being a C and so on. Six (6) unexcused absences will result in an automatic F for the course. Two (2) late arrivals will count for one (1) absence.</p>

<h3>üì¢ Participation</h3>
<p>This class will be highly participatory, and much of the benefit of the class will be shared through the effort of yourself and your peers. You are expected to contribute to discussions, engage in group work, give feedback to your peers, and otherwise fully participate in class.</p>

<h3>üíª Electronics Use</h3>
<p>Recreational use of phones, music players, video game systems and other devices are forbidden. Laptops and tablets are allowed for note taking, in class work, as well as relevant research only. Activities not related to the class, such as recreational use of the internet, including all social media websites, email and instant messaging, game playing, and work for other classes, will not be permitted. Such activities are disrespectful to the instructor and distracting to others. Your laptop should always be closed whenever a fellow student is presenting.</p>

<h3>üñäClass Expectations</h3>
<p>Classes will be a mixture of lectures (including guest lectures), discussion, presentations, workshops, and in-class work sessions (both individual and in groups).</p>

<h3>üóìSchedule</h3>
<p>The course meets once a week for three hours, for a total of 14 weeks.</p>

<h3>üìù Research Paper and Peer Review</h3>
<p>Research papers will be required to roughly follow the organizational conventions and format of submissions to well-known media arts conferences, such as ISEA. The class is designed to help students write this research paper incrementally, section by section (Abstract, Introduction, Related work, Methodology, Conclusion, etc.), alongside production work on their interactive project. In Week 7, students will submit an initial version of this paper as a ‚Äúproposal‚Äù for peer review from their fellow students (and other stakeholders, such as faculty members and field experts), following the conventions of peer-reviewed conferences. (Structure and format of this paper may be adjusted on an individual basis, according to student-identified needs and outcomes.)</p>

<h3>üì•Assignment Submission</h3>
<p>It is expected that you will spend 6 to 8 hours a week on the class outside of class itself. This will include reviewing material, reading, completing assignments and so on. Please budget your time accordingly.</p>
<p>Most weeks have associated assignments. Please refer to the schedule for details on assignment requirements. In general, the assignment for each week relates to the topics of in-class lectures and tutorials. Assignments are designed not just as a way for students to apply what they learned in class, but also to meaningfully advance the student work on their research papers and interactive projects. (Starting in <strong>Week 6</strong>, students are also expected to make weekly progress on the production of their interactive project, in addition to the required assignments.)</p>
<p>Each assignment will be marked as complete (full credit), partially complete (half credit), or incomplete (no credit). To be complete an assignment should meet the criteria specified in the syllabus including documentation. If significant portions are simply not attempted or the assignment is turned in late (up to 1 week) then it may be marked partially complete. If an assignment is late, or shows no attempt to meet the criteria specified, it will be marked incomplete.</p>

<h3>üéû Documentation</h3>
<p>Students are expected to document their ongoing capstone process in a venue where their classmates and teacher can see them (such as a public-facing blog). We‚Äôll discuss the specifics of this on the first day of class. Some updates are specifically required in assignment descriptions (see below), but students are expected to make regular posts documenting their progress beyond those called for explicitly in assignments. (Making these posts counts toward your participation grade.)</p>

<h3>üåå ITP/IMA Thesis Week Presentation</h3>
<p>In addition to in-class final presentations, students are expected to present their work during ITP/IMA Thesis Week (likely May 11th‚Äì14th 2023). This presentation will last ten minutes and will be live-streamed to the ITP/IMA community and the general public.</p>

<h3>üåª Academic Integrity</h3>
<p>Plagiarism is presenting someone else‚Äôs work as though it were your own. More specifically, plagiarism is to present as your own: A sequence of words quoted without quotation marks from another writer or a paraphrased passage from another writer‚Äôs work or facts, ideas or images composed by someone else. More information can be found on <a href="http://tisch.nyu.edu/faculty/academic-integ">Tisch‚Äôs page regarding Academic Integrity</a>.</p>

<h3>ü¶ãAccessibility</h3>
<p>Academic accommodations are available for students with documented disabilities. Please contact the Moses Center for Students with Disabilities at 212 998-4980 for further information.</p>

<p>Your health and safety are a priority at NYU. If you experience any health or mental health issues during this course, we encourage you to utilize the support services of the 24/7 NYU Wellness Exchange 212-443-9999.</p>

<h3>üåºTitle IX</h3>
<p>Tisch School of the Arts is dedicated to providing its students with a learning environment that is rigorous, respectful, supportive and nurturing so that they can engage in the free exchange of ideas and commit themselves fully to the study of their discipline. To that end Tisch is committed to enforcing University policies prohibiting all forms of sexual misconduct as well as discrimination on the basis of sex and gender.</p>
