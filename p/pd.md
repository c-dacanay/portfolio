For the past year I’ve worked as a freelance product designer at places like Cake & Arrow and NYU’s ITP Program. Before that I was on staff at Codecademy with the learner experience and content platform teams. You can read about some of my Codecademy work below, and feel free to email me to see more.


## Learning with Interactive Articles
> How I improved learning efficacy and readability with consistent interactive elements.

ROLE: UR, UX, UI
Duration: 1 month

BACKGROUND

Codecademy is an interactive learning platform that aims to give anyone the opportunity to learn how to code. I collaborated with the learner experience and content platform teams to give interactive articles an updated look and increased usability.

The Challenge

Interactive articles were an under-utilized tool in Codecademy's learning product, and they required an overhaul to both update the brand identity and to increase the usability of their embedded assessments. I believed an updated, integrated experience could help interactive articles become an essential and flexible part of Codecademy's learning product.

The Focus

I pinpointed two problem areas that would drive the redesign:

1. Articles were simply hard to read due to centered, long line lengths and awkward design. Interactive sections were indicated with bulky black boxes that spanned the whole screen. How could I make this experience feel more seamless and integrated?

2. The embedded assessments had unclear interactions. The various content types, such as multiple choice questions and free response questions, were developed by different designers over many years. How could these elements be unified simply within the reading experience?

Discovery & Research

I conducted user interviews with learners who read the articles, curriculum developers who write them, and the content platform engineers who code the components themselves. I learned that everyone was enthusiastic about making articles more readable, and that curriculum had a huge range of use cases for interactive articles.

I dug into other types of editorial experiences with interactive elements, and realized that we were not using our space effectively.  Many other experiences included things like assessment headers, boxed interactive areas, or numbered activities as opposed to the zebra stripe approach.

Additionally with the help of curriculum developers I audited some of Codecademy's oldest and most "unique" interactive articles to see what the affordances were in terms of a major re-design.

The Design Process

I began sketching out different types of reading experiences by playing with line lengths and spacing. With a background in print publishing I was able to push the articles into a more editorial style that made for a more familiar reading experience.

I sketched out ways of signaling interactivity in a way that were subtle yet clear. Each embedded assessments had its own little quirks: some had hints, multiple steps, or unique buttons. It was important to unify these assessments when it was technically possible, and suggest future exploration for refactoring that was out of scope.  For every proposed change to the interactive articles it was important to test accessibility and readability for dark and light styles.

Our Solution

With more editorial line lengths and text sizes sketched out, I began to focus on the specifics of embedded interactive content. I worked closely with engineers to create solutions that could accommodate the ways that curriculum developers had used the assessments over the years.

We moved forward with the dark mode first, with the light mode design waiting in the wings. Many design changes were driven by the new design language developed at Codecademy to best integrate with the primary learning environment.


My Takeaways

This project involved so much cross functional collaboration. Specifically it was so valuable to bring in engineers who knew the back end well into the design process. In particular, Ian Munro's understanding of the history of interactive articles was invaluable and heavily informed the shipped designs.

With input from engineering and curriculum we were able to create a more seamless learning experience through interactive articles. This redesign was used to attract Codecademy's new business clients and boasts significantly 40% longer read times and better learning efficacy than its older variant.

There are many UI decisions I'd love to reconsider but I hope this is one of many opportunities for designers to revisit this area of the product. Codecademy has been a fast growing platform for many years, and I'm proud to have led the first major refactor of the interactive articles experience to the new brand identity.


## Building a Landing Page System
> How I created one source of truth and increased velocity for creating marketing pages in Codecademy’s product.

Landing Page Unification
BACKGROUND
Codecademy is an interactive learning platform that aims to give anyone the opportunity to learn how to code. I worked with marketing and the reach team to help create modular components to build company and promotional pages on the website.

THE CHALLENGE
While components for educational content at Codecademy was fairly unified, all of the company  and marketing pages lacked reusable components. This was a pain point for marketing, design and engineering, because every promotional website had to be thought up, designed and coded from scratch.

Using a 12 grid system I worked in collaboration with Dev Hobdy to create modular components that could be easily reused and look good at any screen size.

THE FOCUS
There were three stages for this design process:

The content audit. There were plenty of company and marketing pages that had been implemented previously, so I didn't want to reinvent the wheel. Which components already used were modular and able to support a variety of content?

The style guide. Once we determined which components were most usable, how can we test Codecademy's style rules around text and spacing to make sure that all these pages look seamless?

The implementation. How can we work with engineers to build out our component library, and make it usable for marketing and designers in the future?

THE PROCESS
We conducted an audit of all of Codecademy’s static pages as well as an archive of the templates used in marketing. We made note of the unique needs of each of the pages and made executive decisions about types of content that we were and were not going to include in the component building process.

The components were categorized into 5 main types: heros, subheaders, grids, prefooters, and info. Many of these types were subdivided by number of columns or expected usage. After determining the types of components worth developing with marketing and engineering, I set to the task of testing text, column and line spacing set by Codecademy’s style guide. 

The visual identity style guide was in development so I worked closely with the Design Ops team when line lengths became unreadable. This was an extremely collaborative process and both the landing page components and the style guide are more unified for it.

Ultimately began the process with 4 MVP components, each designed at 6 screen sizes, to test the process with marketing and engineers.


TAKEAWAYS
Unifying the landing pages was one of my first project proposals; the design work is unglamorous, but the systems thinking and multiple stakeholders involved was an exciting challenge. The opportunity to address a pain point for multiple teams was also met with excitement and enthusiasm, especially because folks had felt included in the process.

I was proud of how much cleaner the pages looked with unified spacing and alignment, and moreover how much easier the design process was for both marketing and the design team.
