                    <p>I was tasked with leading the design for a tailored player experience for the unique tabletop
                        roleplaying game (TTRPG), Yazeba's Bed and Breakfast, on our platform from concept to launch
                        within two months.<br><br>

                        The opinionated design process, continuous user testing, and tight development loop allowed us
                        to accomplish the business goal of cost-effective development while also creating a delightful
                        online play experience that we felt was true to the heart of the intended tabletop experience.
                        The Yazeba's bundle sold 3,000 units and was featured on the itch.io front page.

            <h3>Finding Our Principles</h3>
            <p>
                After the core team had familiarized ourselves with the book and played a few chapters of the TTRPG, I
                led a three-hour design sprint with the core team. Our primary goal was to align our business objectives
                with our vision for the game, ensuring that every decision made during development was consistent with
                our guiding principles.
            </p>
            <p>
                During the sprint we engaged in several collaborative activities including brainstorming sessions,
                competitive analysis, and empathy mapping. We discussed the unique qualities of Yazeba's Bed and
                Breakfast, such as its emotional depth and the importance of emergent, player-led gameplay. We focused
                on how we could translate these qualities into a digital format while keeping the experience dynamic and
                full of surprises. We also identified the core values that would drive our design, such as user
                accessibility, immersive storytelling, and preserving the collaborative spirit of the tabletop
                experience.
            </p>

            alt="A gif of a space invader made out of checked and unchecked marks.">
            <p>
                By the end of the sprint, we had established a clear set of design principles that would guide us
                through development. These principles included maintaining a user-centric approach, focusing on
                simplicity and clarity in our tech and UI/UX design, and ensuring that the digital experience remained
                true to the original game's intent and mechanics. These principles allowed us to make informed and
                consistent decisions quickly and independently throughout the project.

            <h3>The Process</h3>
            <p>

                During our sprint we determined what we’d need to build from scratch versus what we could simply reskin
                from the existing platform. While the engineers set off to leverage existing assets I began sketching
                how we might represent some of the TTRPG’s more novel mechanics. A key aspect was designing for emergent
                gameplay, ensuring that players would encounter delightful surprises that could inspire creative
                interactions.
            </p>
            <img src="../src/images/yazebas/flows.png" class="imghero"
            alt="A gif of a space invader made out of checked and unchecked marks.">
            <p>
                I mapped out the entire game experience, creating user journey maps that outlined each game phase. This
                included the sequence of activities players would engage in, from setting up the game to progressing
                through various chapters and game phases. Each flow was carefully crafted to ensure a smooth transition
                between play modes, maintaining player engagement and minimizing any potential frustration. Every new
                game feature was designed with the potential for player-generated surprises in mind.
            </p>

            <h3>Testing and Feedback</h3>

            <p>
                To ensure the user experience was as seamless and engaging as possible, we conducted multiple rounds of
                internal testing throughout the development process. As every feature rolled out and as we designed
                different flows we'd invite members outside of the team to play and offer their feedback.
            </p>
            <img src="../src/images/yazebas/guests.png" class="imghero"
            alt="A gif of a space invader made out of checked and unchecked marks.">
            <p>
                During these sessions, we closely observed how players interacted with the game, noting any points of
                friction or confusion. At different times we'd focus on aspects such as the intuitiveness of the UI, the
                clarity of game instructions, and the overall enjoyment of the experience. We paid special attention to
                how players responded to the non-dice related gameplay elements, ensuring that these features were
                intuitive and added depth to the experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                Based on this feedback, we iterated on our designs, refining the user interface and information
                architecture. One significant change was simplifying the chapter selection screen to highlight the
                custom illustration while also showing the chapter's tone and what characters were required to play. We
                also enhanced the tutorial sequence, making it more interactive and aligned with the playbook's
                narrative style, while also emphasizing the open ended possibilities of digital play.
            </p>

            <h3>Building the B&B</h3>
            <p>With a motivated, high-trust team and many productive constraints, we surpassed our own expectations.
                Players can collect stickers, swap coins, and move through the seasons as they play through the chapters
                of the game. We were also able to squeeze in some of our pet features before the end of our time limit,
                including a polaroid feature, doodle pages, and a custom tutorial sequence that draws on the
                introduction to the playbook. The incorporation of playful and creative game tools ensured that each
                playthrough could be unique and full of delightful surprises, staying true to the spirit of the original
                tabletop experience.
