      <p>I’m your resident jack-of-all-trades: product designer, front-end tinkerer, illustrator, and design system maintainer. I’ve worked on projects across gaming, education, and creative tools and I am passionate about building experiences that foster learning, creative play, and collaboration.</p>
      <p>Beyond digital design I’m a teacher, open-source project maintainer, tabletop roleplaying enthusiast, and someone who loves making things with my hands.</p>

      <h1>Focus Areas</h1>
      
      <h3>Clear comms and visual storytelling</h3>
      <p>I use visual design, motion, and well-crafted presentations to ensure that ideas resonate with diverse audiences and drive alignment across teams.</p>

      <h3>Creating structure in ambiguity</h3>
      <p>I have a knack for adding clarity and structure to ambiguous problems and environments. I am able to align team members, push for decisions, and turn complex challenges into actionable steps.</p>

      <h3>Collaboration as a craft</h3>
      <p>I care deeply about building strong, trusting relationships with my teams. I love to share — and it's always better to share a win.</p>

      <h3>Working close with code</h3>
      <p>As a designer who codes I have a strong grasp of software systems and their constraints. I’m comfortable jumping in alongside my developers as needed, whether that’s building UI in prototypes or fixing small production bugs.</p>
